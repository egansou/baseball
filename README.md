## Repository for the major league project

### Overview
Major League Baseball is a professional baseball league, where teams pay players to play baseball. The goal of each team is to win as many games out of a 162 game season as possible. Teams win games by scoring more runs than their adversary. In principle, better players are costlier, so teams that want good players need to spend more money. Teams that spend the most, frequently win the most. So, the question is, how can a team that can't spend so much win? The basic idea that Oakland (and other teams) used is to redefine what makes a player good, i.e., figure out what player characteristics translated into wins. Once they realized that teams were not really pricing players using these characteristics, they could exploit this to pay for undervalued players, players that were good according to their metrics, but were not recognized as such by other teams, and therefore not as expensive.

### Problem 

We want to understand how efficient teams have been historically at spending money and getting wins in return. In the case of Moneyball, one would expect that Oakland was not much more efficient than other teams in their spending before 2000, were much more efficient (they made a movie about it after all) between 2000 and 2005, and by then other teams may have caught up. We will see how this is reflected in the data we have.
